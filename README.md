# Weather-Dashboard

I have been tasked with creating a weather dashboard to display the current weather and a five day forcast for what is to come. I want the user to see the weather for the city that they serch for and also the previous searches that they have searched for. I used the OpenWeather API and local storage to accomplish this.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## The Journey

I have not had much experience using API's before this assignment. To be honest, I was a little nervous to be using an API. It looked like this big mean monster that I would have to take down. It turned out to be way more manageable than I imagined. Once I figured out the API, the rest wasn't too bad. I just had to place things in their designated spot. The last big challenge for me was to link the previous search's data back to the page. I used an event target listener to get the value of the button pressed. I used that value to replace the city in the API from before. I had a lot fo fun with this assignment and I look forward to more in the future!
